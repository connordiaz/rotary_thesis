    '''Produces a rotary coefficient with depth profile for velocity and shear using half-overlapping windows
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    initial_lag_m : float or int
    window_length_m : float or int
    u : xarray.core.dataarray.DataArray or np.ndarray
        1D zonal velocity depth array  
    v : xarray.core.dataarray.DataArray or np.ndarray 
        1D meridional velocity depth array 
    N : xarray.core.dataarray.DataArray or np.ndarray 
        1D buoyancy frequency depth array 
    vel_depth : xarray.core.dataarray.DataArray or np.ndarray 
        1D LADCP depth array 
    ctd_depth : xarray.core.dataarray.DataArray or np.ndarray 
        1D CTD depth array 
    v_spacing : float or int, optional 
        spacing in [m] of the LADCP measurements. Default is set to 5m as in the original FSDB_SR1b_V0.1_20221013
        dataset. This is used to index properly. 
    cutoffs : list 
        Spectral wavenumber cutoffs for integration of power. Must contain two numbers, unordered is fine: 
        low wavenumber cutoff and high wavenumber cutoff. 
    N_normalize : bool, optional 
        Determines if the Fourier coefficients are computed from the u + iv series normalized 
        by the depth mean of the given buoyancy frequency array. Default value is True. 
    transfer : bool, optional 
        Determines if the Fourier coefficients are spectrally corrected (transferred) according
        to Thurnherr, 2012. Default value is True
    density : bool, optional
        Determines if the resulting rotary coefficients are calculated from power density (PSD). 
        Default is False. 
    method : str, optional
    	'coeff last' or 'coeff first'. The computational method used for calculating the rotary coefficients. 
    	Default is 'coeff last', the typical implementation. See `rotary_coefficient` function for more. 
    
    Returns
    -------
    (R_c_vel_prof, R_c_sh_prof, midp) : tuple
        R_c_vel_prof : np.ndarray  
            Array of velocity rotary coefficients computed in each window. Size is the number of windows. 
        R_c_sh_prof : np.ndarray
            Array of shear rotary coefficients computed in each window. Size is the number of windows. 
        midp : np.ndarray
            Array of the depth midpoints of the successive windows. These are the depths to which each
            rotary coefficient is attributed in a rotary coefficient depth profile. 
    
    Notes
    -----
    This implementation is hard coded for half-overlapping windows. Will catch errors computing rotary 
    coefficients and store them as np.nan for the profile.
