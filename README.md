This repository includes all of the data, scripts, and jupyter notebooks used to carry out the analysis in my undergraduate thesis: Vertical Wavenumber Rotary Coefficients in Velocity and Shear - A Systematic Comparison in the Drake Passage. 

`original_data_copy` is the unpublished `FSDB_SR1b_V0.1_20221013` database provided by Andreas Thurnherr. 

`experimental_data_copy` contains files of the rotary coefficients profiles that were produced from the experiments of this thesis. The notebook that produced this data is `produce_data.ipynb`

`rotary_analysis.py` is the library of custom functions used to analyze data from `FSDB_SR1b_V0.1_20221013` 

The bulk of the analysis is contained in `first_viz_figures.ipynb` with a few figures coming from `rotary_test_v2.ipynb`
