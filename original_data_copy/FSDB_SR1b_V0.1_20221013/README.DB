SR1b SOUTHERN OCEAN REPEAT SECTION FINESTRUCTURE DATABASE

Reference: Thurnherr et al. (JPO, in prep)

HISTORY:
	V0.0 (20220619):
		- initial release with data used during preparation of manuscript draft
	V0.1 (20221013):
		- 
		- added LADCP profiles

======================================================================

=Overview=

This data base contains three sets of profiles with CTD, LADCP, as well
as several derived finestructure parameterizations from the 19 repeat
occupations of the UK SR1b section across the ACC carried out between
2002 and 2019. The section consists of 27 repeat stations (R01-R27).
For each repeat station there are three netCDF data files with time
series of vertical profiles: a CTD file with the suffix _CTD.nc, a
LADCP file with the suffix _LADCP.nc, and a finestructure parameter
file with the suffix _FSP.nc.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

=Database Version Numbers and Release Dates=

The data base is identified by its release date (20220619 for the
initial release) and version number (e.g. V0.0). Version numbers < 1.0
are used for pre-publication work; once the manuscript has been
accepted, the version number of the data base will be increased to 1.0
(major version 1, sub-version 0). Every time the data base is updated,
the version number is increased. The minor version number is increase
on simple corrections, such as bug fixes, that do not require changes
in the documentation. Changes in the major version indicate more
substantial updates, such as changes in the methodology or addition of
new sections or finestructure parameters. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

=netCDF Conventions and Units=

All variables and attributes have unabbreviated names, such as "depth",
"buoyancy-frequency", "shear-to-strain-variance-ratio", etc. Each
variable has its units recorded in the ":units" attribute (e.g.
"depth:units"); SI units are used throughout. Variables with missing
units attributes are dimensionless. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

=CTD Profiles=

Each CTD file (e.g. R10_CTD.nc) contains a time series of CTD profiles
(indexed by the profile_number netCDF coordinate) and binned at 1.25m
vertical resolution. Because some of the profiles were collected before
2010, the EOS83 (with ITS-90) is used throughout. 

Each profile contains the following metadata:
	cruise_id					e.g. 2002_JR81; see reference for
								additional information 
	date						date when profile was collected
	time						time at start of profile
	station_number				original station number used on the
								cruise 
	latitude					latitude in degrees East
	longitude					longitude in degrees North
	DB_version					database version (see above)

Each profiles contains the following depth-binned quantities, indexed
by the depth_coordinate netCDF coordinate:
	depth						vertical distance from the sea surface
	height_above_seabed			vertical distance from the sea bed
	potential_temperature		potential temperature
	practical_salinity			practical salinity
	neutral_density_gamma_n		unitless neutral density of Jackett and
								McDougall (JPO 1997)
	buoyancy_frequency			buoyancy frequency (density
								stratification)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

=LADCP Profiles=

Each LADCP file (e.g. R10_LADCP.nc) contains a time series of LADCP
profiles (indexed by the profile_number netCDF coordinate) of all three
components of the velocity field, resampled to 5m vertical resolution
with linear interpolation. Note that this amounts to oversampling of
the original velocity profiles, which are binned at ~8m for the
horizontal components, and at 40m for vertical velocity.

Each profile contains the following metadata:
	cruise_id					e.g. 2002_JR81; see reference for
								additional information 
	date						date when profile was collected
	time						time at start of profile
	station_number				original station number used on the
								cruise 
	latitude					latitude in degrees East
	longitude					longitude in degrees North
	DB_version					database version (see above)

Each profiles contains the following depth-binned quantities, indexed
by the depth_coordinate netCDF coordinate:
	depth						vertical distance from the sea surface
	height_above_seabed			vertical distance from the sea bed
	zonal_velocity				u, positive eastward
	meridional_velocity			v, postiive northward
	downcast_vertical_velocity	w, positive upward
	upcast_vertical_velocity	w, positive upward

----------------------------------------------------------------------

=Finestructure Profiles=

Each finestructure data file (e.g. R10_FSP.nc) contains a time series
of LADCP data and derived finestructure variables in 320-m-thick
half-overlapping bins, starting near the surface with an additional
window covering the bottom-most part of the profile. Each profile
contains the same metadata as the corresponding CTD and LADCP profiles
(see above).

For each window, the following variables are recorded:
	window_index				starting at 1 near the surface; -1 for
								the bottom window
	window_depth.min			upper limit of window
	window_depth.max			lower limit of window

Because of differences in depth resolution and bottom gaps of the
different data sources, there are generally small differences between
the windows used for the different finestructure parameters. For most
purposes these differences can safely be ignored. The following 
variables define the nominal depths of each recorded quantity:
	depth						depth of the middle of the strain window
	hab							water-depth minus "depth" variable

In addition to the windowing and depth information, each profile
contains the following finestructure quantities:
	strain_buoyancy_frequency	average buoyancy frequency in the strain 
								window 
	strain_finescale_power		finescale strain level
	strain_GM76_power			finescale strain level in the
								Garrett-Munk model
	strain_normalized_finescale_power
								finescale strain level normalized by GM
	strain_spectral_slope		finescale spectral slope on a log-log
								plot (power-law exponent)

								window 
	shear_finescale_rotary_power_positive
	shear_finescale_rotary_power_negative

								p0 of Thurnherr et al. (GRL 2015)
	vertical_kinetic_energy_spectral_slope

Each profile additionally contains the following LADCP-derived

calculations:
	zonal_velocity				u
	meridional_velocity			v
	horizontal_kinetic_energy	u^2+v^2
